## start up

run `npm start` in one terminal and `npm run hotloader` in another

To run the LLM parts of the app:
1. Make a virtual environment: `python3 -m venv .venv`. This virtual environment should be in Python 3.10 or earlier; Python 3.11+ won't work.
2. Activate the virtual environment (venv): `. .venv/bin/activate`
3. Install the dependencies from requirements.txt in the venv: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
4. Run the local ChromaDB instance: `chroma run`
5. Set the environment variable `ANYSCALE_API_KEY`. Using a .env file is probably the simplest way to do this.
